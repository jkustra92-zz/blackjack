### Description

A digital representation of the world's most widely played banking casino game. The objective is for a player to best the
dealer by either getting twenty-one points on their first hand, having their final hand be higher than the dealer without
exceeding twenty one, or by having the dealer draw cards until they exceed twenty one.

### Tech used / Stack
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- jQuery library

### Features
- Player can choose whether to hit or stay (an option given to them if their current hand is under 21)
- Mimics real life Blackjack and forces the dealer to draw if their hand is under 17.
- Object-oriented programming allows total money and betting data to be stored for a prolonged gaming experience

### Future Implementations
- A double down function to allow the player to double their bet.
- To add onto that, a split function allowing players to split their hand into two separate ones.
- Multiple player capabilities so it's not just player vs. dealer!
